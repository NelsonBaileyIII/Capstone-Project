# Color-App

The Color application uses image recognition to predict what the dominant colors are in a given picture. The colors are then used to generate a suggested color palette with colors that work well together. This works in a semi-random way, so hit regenerate to see a different color set each time.

### User Story:

- User can upload a picture url, capture the main colors, and generate a selected color palette
- User can adjust colors
- User can save palettes for future reference
- User can create a new user profile and login


## How it works

The Color Pic application uses image recognition from [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) to predict what the dominant colors are in a given picture. The colors are then sent to [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate a suggested color palette, it searches for colors that work well together. The palettes are generated in a semi-random way. The app also uses [React Color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/) for color adjustments.
